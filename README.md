# php-login-register
A kinda secure php login register system



Note: This doesnt promise to be super secure, its some of my older code but fixed up. I recommend you improve it. config.php has database information/a few variables/functions and navbar.php is the navbar


What you should probably do:
1: Make some more statements prepared
2: Secure Cookies
3: Improve on the code.


Love you.
